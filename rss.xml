  <title>UI Suite Monthly #25 - Celebrating 5 Years with Major Releases and Growing Community</title>
  <link>https://uisuite.net/ui-suite-monthly-25-celebrating-5-years-anniversary</link>
  <description>We marked a significant milestone in our March 2025 monthly meeting, celebrating five years of organized development while announcing major releases and demonstrating growing community momentum. Our meeting showcased substantial progress across our ecosystem of design system modules for Drupal.Overall SummaryOur 25th monthly meeting highlighted our evolution from scattered tools to a cohesive design system implementation platform. We celebrated our 5th anniversary since going public, with two major module releases now integrated into Drupal core. Our meeting featured 14-15 participants discussing recent achievements, including UI Patterns 2.0's successful release after 18 months of development, new icon API integration in Drupal core, and expanding adoption metrics showing 30 new installations weekly.We have successfully positioned ourselves as a bridge technology while Drupal CMS explores Experience Builder, with UI Patterns 2 teaching the community component-based development practices. Our meeting demonstrated increasing community engagement through Reddit posts, Slack activity, and growing statistics across all our projects.Key Topics DiscussedUI Patterns 2.0 Success and UI Patterns UI Demo - Our flagship module completed its challenging 18-month development cycle with a 20-person team. Our release introduced UI Patterns UI, a new interface allowing content editors to configure components widgets without developer intervention. Christian demonstrated the field UI-like functionality, showing how different form modes can be created for varying contributor experiences, making our powerful but complex system more user-friendly.Icon API Integration Achievement - We celebrated getting our Icon API directly into Drupal 11.1 core through the navigation module. This integration provides official icon pack usage and enables broader adoption across core modules, with plans for field integration and enhanced developer experience.UI Suite Bootstrap Theme Improvements - Significant updates to our Bootstrap implementation included comprehensive component library enhancements using UI Patterns 2 stories system. We addressed modal handling issues, CKEditor 5 integration problems, and expanded component demonstrations beyond official Bootstrap documentation to include edge cases and extreme usage scenarios.Design System Theme Updates - Multiple theme implementations received updates: Daisy UI completed migration to version 5 in just two days, demonstrating the power of our UI framework; DSFR (French government design system) progressed toward 1.1.0 release candidate; and various ecosystem themes advanced UI Patterns 2 compatibility.Community Growth and Adoption Metrics Our community crossed 300 members and continues growing monthly. UI Patterns gained popularity ranking around 500th most popular Drupal module. We addressed composer namespace conflicts affecting field group integration and discussed case study development to showcase agency implementations.Technology Discussions Our meeting included spirited debates about Tailwind CSS adoption, with team members expressing divided opinions on utility-first frameworks versus component-based approaches. We also discussed Adobe Spectrum integration possibilities and addressed questions about component filtering and organization.Key Action PointsImmediate Development PrioritiesWe have prioritized finalizing UI Patterns UI for our spring 2.1 release targeted for the May-July timeframe, representing a major milestone in making our powerful but complex system more accessible to content editors. Our key immediate tasks include:Complete UI Patterns 2 documentation updates for both users and developersRelease UI Styles 2 and investigate Styles API integration into Drupal coreAddress composer namespace conflicts affecting field group and space modulesImplement seasonal release schedule with spring (2.1) and summer (2.2) versionsCommunity and DocumentationOur community engagement efforts focus on developing compelling case studies that showcase real agency projects using UI Patterns 2, providing concrete examples for potential adopters while promoting participating agencies. We recognize the urgent need to replace our current documentation strategy:Update drupal.org documentation to replace outdated and confusing contentExpand component library demonstrations with extreme use cases and edge scenariosCreate presentation materials for upcoming conferences and local eventsDevelop case studies showcasing agency implementationsTechnical RoadmapOur technical roadmap emphasizes progressive migration of UI Patterns 2 components into Drupal core, building on our success with Icon API integration in the navigation module.

  <title>UI Suite Monthly #04 - Bridging Core Integration and Drupal 10 Compatibility</title>
  <link>https://uisuite.net/ui-suite-monthly-04-bridging-core-integration-and-drupal-10-compatibility</link>
  <description>Overall SummaryWe held our fourth monthly meeting to discuss progress on our ecosystem of Drupal UI modules, including UI Patterns, UI Styles, UI Skins, and related components. Our meeting covered significant developments in Drupal 10 compatibility, major architectural discussions with Drupal core maintainers, and our community coordination efforts.Key highlights include our productive meeting with core maintainers about the Single Directory Component (SDC) project and UI component initiatives, our successful releases achieving Drupal 10 compatibility across the ecosystem, and ongoing discussions about our module consolidation and community governance.Key Topics DiscussedCore Integration DiscussionsWe had a significant meeting with core maintainers on December 23rd about the SDC (Single Directory Component) project and UI component in core initiative. Core maintainers proposed that our UI Patterns could become a wrapper around SDC, with UI Patterns serving as a model to expose the component API. This would require substantial architectural changes and potentially breaking changes for our UI Patterns module.Drupal 10 Compatibility ProgressOur ecosystem has made substantial progress on Drupal 10 compatibility. Most of our important modules are now compatible, with approximately half of our UI Patterns ecosystem successfully converted. Some modules still require our attention, including components maintained by Alex and Christian that need our community outreach.Module Ecosystem ManagementWe discussed the management of related modules like Display Suite and UI Patterns Display Suite. Our team debated whether to maintain separate modules or consolidate functionality directly into our UI Patterns core, considering both maintenance burden and community needs.UI Styles and UI Skins ConsistencyWe had major discussions focused on achieving consistency across our UI ecosystem, particularly regarding:Grouping and sorting mechanisms for our styles and patternsForm configuration consistency between our UI Styles and UI SkinsImplementation of alphabetical sorting with optional weighting systemsPlugin definition class improvements and breaking changesCKEditor 5 IntegrationWe reported progress on CKEditor 5 integration for our UI Styles, with PHP implementation completed and JavaScript development planned as our next phase.Community Initiative StatusWe discussed promoting our UI Suite as an official Drupal community initiative, recognizing our need for better organization and formal recognition within the broader Drupal community.Key Action PointsImmediate ActionsContact Antonio and maintainers: We need to reach out to module maintainers for Drupal 10 compatibility assistanceOpen GitHub issues: We must create issues for patent consolidation discussionsDisplay Suite evaluation: We need to assess whether our Display Suite modules should be integrated into UI Patterns or maintained separatelyModule maintainer outreach: We must contact Christian and Alex regarding module maintenance and compatibilityDevelopment TasksUI Styles 1.4 release: We need to complete views integration and CKEditor 5 compatibilityGrouping implementation: We must add consistent grouping and sorting mechanisms across our UI Styles, UI Skins, and UI PatternsPlugin definition updates: We need to implement breaking changes for improved API consistencyLayout Builder regression: We must address ongoing issues with our Layout Builder compatibilityDocumentation and CommunityChange records: We need to create documentation for breaking changes in our plugin definitionsIssue queue management: We must ensure our issues don't stagnate and maintain active development momentumCommunity initiative application: We should explore registering our UI Suite as an official Drupal community initiativeUpcoming Deadlines / ReleasesModule/ComponentVersionTarget ReleaseKey FeaturesStatusUI Styles1.4Q1 2023Views integration, CKEditor 5 compatibilityIn DevelopmentUI PatternsTBDBefore Drupal 10.1SDC wrapper integration, plugin discovery updatesPlanning PhaseUI SkinsTBDQ1 2023Consistency improvements, grouping featuresIn DevelopmentLayout Options1.1+OngoingBug fixes, Drupal 10 compatibilityMaintenanceUI Patterns ExtendedBeta 3TBDChristian's updates (details pending)Pending UpdateCritical DependenciesDrupal 10.1 release: Our UI component integration timeline depends on core release scheduleSDC project timeline: Our UI Patterns architectural changes tied to Single Directory Component availabilityCommunity maintainer availability: Several of our updates dependent on volunteer maintainer capacityNext MeetingDate: February 14, 2023 (rescheduled from February 7th) Focus: Follow-up on our SDC discussions, development progress review, and our community initiative planningOur UI Suite Initiative continues to be a vital community-driven effort to improve Drupal's component ecosystem.

  <title>UI Suite Monthly #03 - December 2022 Progress Update</title>
  <link>https://uisuite.net/ui-suite-monthly-03-december-2022-progress-update</link>
  <description>The UI Suite Initiative represents our ambitious effort to bring comprehensive design system capabilities to Drupal through a collection of interconnected modules. As organizations increasingly adopt design systems to maintain consistency across digital properties, we recognize the critical need for robust tooling within content management systems. Our December 2022 meeting captured a pivotal moment for our project, occurring just as Drupal 10 was launching and as we introduced innovative features like dynamic CSS variable management.Overall SummaryWe held our third monthly meeting on December 13, 2022, discussing progress on our comprehensive set of Drupal modules designed to implement Design Systems. Our UI Suite consists of independent but interconnected modules that provide a unified experience for building design system components in Drupal. The meeting covered our upcoming Drupal 10 compatibility, module releases, new features like our UI Skins module for CSS variable management, and ongoing discussions about module organization and security coverage.Key Topics DiscussedDrupal 10 Compatibility We announced that Drupal 10 would be released the following day (December 14, 2022), with the 9-to-10 upgrade being easier than the previous 8-to-9 transition. Several of our UI Suite modules are already prepared for compatibility, including some that our team members can update independently (FIFA, matter flag, settings decoupled) and others requiring coordination with external maintainers.Module Releases and UpdatesWe released UI Patterns beta 2 in early November with prefixes and history improvementsPage Designer version 1.2 was released the previous weekWe have plans for UI Styles 1.3 release with Views integration and minor compatibility breaks in library Twig filesWe discussed moving to more frequent releases with fewer features rather than waiting for comprehensive updatesSecurity Coverage Initiative We discussed applying for security coverage for our modules as they mature and gain stable releases. This involves specific processes on drupal.org that require particular permissions and roles, with some complexity around maintainer access rights.New Module: UI Skins A significant portion of our meeting focused on demonstrating UI Skins, our new module that integrates CSS variables (custom properties) with theme management. Our module allows dynamic color and styling changes through a configuration interface, demonstrated with Material Design integration. Our system maintains semantic color meanings while allowing visual customization.Pattern Sorting Enhancement We reviewed a merge request for sorting our UI Patterns definitions alphabetically by label rather than machine name, improving user experience in pattern selection interfaces.Layout Builder Integration We discussed ongoing issues with Layout Builder integration, noting that only a minority of our team members actively use Layout Builder, which sometimes delays bug discovery. We mentioned a bug fix for UI Styles in Layout Builder contexts as upcoming.Key Action PointsRelease Management: We will proceed with more frequent, incremental releases rather than waiting for complete feature setsSecurity Coverage: We will apply for security coverage for our mature modules after Drupal 10 releaseUI Skins Development: We will continue development of our CSS variables integration module with focus on Material Design and Bootstrap compatibilityPattern Sorting: We will merge our alphabetical sorting improvement for pattern definitionsLayout Builder Support: We will address remaining Layout Builder integration issues and consider broader adoption patternsCommunity Engagement: We will respond to inquiries about Single Directory Components and schedule follow-up meetingsUpcoming Deadlines / ReleasesModule/ItemTarget ReleaseStatusNotesDrupal 10December 14, 2022ImminentDay after our meetingUI PatternsSame day as meetingIn ProgressOur democratic decision to release with available featuresUI Styles 1.3Short termPlannedViews integration, minor breaking changesUI Skins AlphaSoonIn DevelopmentCSS variables integration, Material Design testedPattern Sorting FixSame day as meetingReady for mergeAwaiting our final reviewLayout Builder Bug Fix"For Christmas"PlannedUI Styles Layout Builder integration fixSecurity Coverage ApplicationsAfter Drupal 10 releasePlannedFor all our mature modulesOur Next Team MeetingJanuary 10, 2023, 11 AMScheduledMaintaining our monthly cadenceOur meeting demonstrated our project's momentum toward Drupal 10 compatibility while introducing innovative features like dynamic theming through CSS variables, positioning our UI Suite as a comprehensive solution for design system implementation in Drupal.</description>

  <title>UI Suite Monthly #02 - Progress Updates and New Module Introduction</title>
  <link>https://uisuite.net/ui-suite-monthly-02-progress-updates-and-new-module-introduction</link>
  <description>The UI Suite Initiative held its second monthly meeting on November 8, 2022, bringing together contributors to discuss ongoing developments, introduce new modules, and address key technical challenges facing the Drupal component ecosystem.Overall SummaryThis meeting served as a comprehensive update on the UI Suite ecosystem's evolution, covering everything from administrative changes to new module introductions. The team addressed the migration from GitHub to Drupal.org's issue queue, discussed code consolidation strategies, and introduced important terminology clarifications around "slots" and "props" borrowed from Vue.js concepts.A significant portion of the meeting focused on introducing UI Skins, the fifth module in the UI Suite family, designed to handle global CSS variables and theme settings. The session concluded with a practical demonstration of the Material Design implementation using the new UI Skins module, showcasing real-time color and layout adjustments through a configuration interface.Key Topics DiscussedIssue Queue Migration and GitHub StatusThe team confirmed the successful migration to Drupal.org's issue queue while noting that GitHub issue creation remains technically possible. The last GitHub issue was created on September 15, before the UI Patterns 1.3 release. Contributors are working to find ways to disable GitHub issue creation without deleting existing issues.Code Consolidation StrategyThe ongoing discussion about consolidating the five UI Pattern modules continues. Current modules include the core library plus two modules related to Core API and two for contributed APIs. The team is considering whether to move contributed modules out of UI Patterns or bring certain contributed modules into the main project, with input needed from Antonio and Fabian.Slots vs Props TerminologyThe team formalized vocabulary borrowed from Vue.js to distinguish between two types of component data:Slots: Free renderable content (strings, elements, or renderable objects) that can be thrown into templatesProps: Rigid types with specific value requirements (booleans, URLs, specific values)This distinction helps clarify component architecture and data constraints, with the proposal to use "fields" for slots and "settings" for props in UI Patterns.UI Styles Type Options Module DiscoveryThe team discovered a competing module called "Type Options" that shares similarities with UI Styles. Created around the same time, it follows UI Styles philosophy by declaring everything in YAML files and generating plugins. The module offers two integrations: one with Layered Plugin and another with Paragraph types. The team plans to contact the maintainers to explore potential collaboration or merging.Introduction of UI Skins ModuleThe meeting's major announcement was UI Skins, the fifth module in the UI Suite ecosystem. This module implements three key features:Global CSS Variables: CSS properties that enable theme-wide customizationTheme Settings Integration: Allows front-end developers to edit YAML files instead of custom PHP codeDesign System Support: Enables features like dark mode, light mode, and other theme variationsDocumentation Migration DiscussionThe team debated moving documentation from GitHub Pages to Drupal.org's documentation system. This would allow broader community participation in documentation maintenance and ensure consistency across the ecosystem. The current documentation consists of approximately eight pages that would need to be converted from RST format.Library Sorting StandardsA discussion arose about standardizing how patterns and styles are sorted in libraries. The team decided to sort by labels (visible to users) rather than machine names, making the interface more user-friendly for site builders and clients who interact with the pattern libraries.Key Action PointsScope Lock for UI Patterns 1.4: Finalize the scope and stop adding new features to ensure release progressionGitHub Issue Migration: Contributors wanting specific GitHub issues addressed must create corresponding Drupal.org issues and migrate their merge requestsUI Skins Testing: Expand testing beyond Material Design to include additional themes, with Bootstrap 5 presenting particular challenges due to CSS variable complexityDocumentation Migration: Convert eight pages of documentation from GitHub to Drupal.org formatType Options Module Outreach: Contact the Type Options module maintainers to explore collaboration opportunitiesMonthly Meeting Structure: Implement a formal issue queue for meeting preparation and reportingTerminology Standardization: Begin implementing the slots/props (fields/settings) terminology across UI Bootstrap and other implementationsUpcoming Deadlines / ReleasesModule/ProjectTarget ReleaseScope StatusKey FeaturesUI Patterns 1.4Before next meetingScope locked - 12-13 issuesWishlist-based improvements, GitHub issue migrationUI StylesNew release plannedAPI improvements in progressViews integration, testing requirementsUI SkinsAlpha/Internal releaseMaterial Design workingGlobal CSS variables, theme settingsCKEditor 5 MigrationDecember 2022 (tentative)Dependent on project needsAfter UI Skins and UI Styles stabilizationNext Monthly MeetingDecember 13, 2022Meeting preparationAvoiding holiday conflictsBootstrap 5 ImplementationTBDChallenges with CSS variablesComplex variable exposure issuesThe meeting demonstrated the UI Suite Initiative's continued momentum, with active development across multiple modules and a clear roadmap for upcoming releases. The introduction of UI Skins represents a significant step forward in providing comprehensive theming capabilities for Drupal component-based architectures.</description>

  <title>UI Suite Monthly #01 - Progress Update and Future Roadmap</title>
  <link>https://uisuite.net/ui-suite-monthly-01-progress-update-future-roadmap</link>
  <description>The UI Suite Initiative held its first monthly meeting on October 11, 2022, bringing together developers and contributors to discuss the current state of the project and plan for future developments. This comprehensive session covered recent achievements, upcoming releases, and important architectural decisions that will shape the future of UI component development in Drupal.Overall SummaryThe UI Suite Initiative aims to implement full Design Systems in Drupal, expanding beyond the current offerings of components, solutions, layouts, and examples. The project's dual mission focuses on preserving and improving the developer building experience while creating implementation value without requiring PHP expertise.The meeting highlighted significant progress made in September, including the anticipated UI Patterns release and improved compatibility with PHP 8.1 and Drupal 10. A major milestone was the development move to drupal.org, centralizing repository management, CI processes, and issue tracking. The team also discussed two complex technical subjects: the proposed UI Theme module for CSS variable management and the ongoing debate around type validation and field filtering in UI Patterns.Key Topics DiscussedRecent Achievements and ReleasesUI Patterns Updates: The team delivered the expected UI Patterns release in late September, featuring enhanced PHP 8.1 and Drupal 10 compatibility. Development has officially moved to drupal.org, streamlining the contribution process and issue management.UI Patterns Settings Evolution: Version 2.0 beta was released with substantial new features, creating a significant gap between branch 1.x and 2.x. The module has become particularly valuable for Layout Builder configurations, offering numerous widgets for sidebar customization.Design System Implementation: Two new themes were released in alpha - Protocol and Material - serving as crucial testing grounds for UI Suite modules. These implementations help validate use cases when working with existing design systems rather than custom client projects.Proposed UI Theme ModuleThe team discussed creating a new module (tentatively called "UI Theme") to handle CSS variable management and theming capabilities. This module would address the need for runtime-changeable design tokens, similar to how Bootstrap allows primary color customization or Material Design supports theme variations.Key features would include:YAML-based configuration for design tokensRuntime CSS variable modificationIntegration with existing design systemsSupport for accessibility themes (light/dark modes)UI for site builders to define theme settingsType Validation and Field ArchitectureA significant portion of the meeting focused on improving UI Patterns' data handling and validation. The team identified four distinct use cases:Open Content Fields: Where any data type can be injected (markup, strings, integers, arrays)Sequence/List Fields: For looping operations requiring array structuresNon-Markup Values: Strictly typed fields for attributes that cannot contain markupStructured Data: Specific data structures like Drupal menu itemsThe discussion explored adopting React-like concepts of "props" and "slots" to better organize component data:Slots: Content areas that can accept various data types (equivalent to current fields)Props: Typed properties for configuration and structured data (similar to UI Patterns Settings)Key Action PointsImmediate TasksRepository Management: Contact Antonio regarding GitHub repository access to implement read-only status and redirect users to drupal.orgIssue Migration: Move remaining GitHub issues to Drupal's issue queue for centralized trackingRelease Planning: Finalize UI Patterns 1.4 scope using the issue created by Michael that combines community wish listsDocumentation: Share presentation slides and video recording publiclyDevelopment PrioritiesUI Styles Integration: Expand compatibility beyond Layout Builder to include:CKEditor 5 integrationViews integration (currently in testing)General form integration for broader applicabilityUI Theme Module Development: Begin specification and development of the CSS variable management system with YAML configuration supportArchitecture Review: Consider props/slots implementation for better type safety and developer experienceCommunity EngagementLinkedIn Group: Continue building the 55-member community for sharing updates and discussionsDrupalCon Planning: Prepare for the next summer event in France (first French DrupalCon since 2009)Issue Discussion: Engage with community feedback on component definition formats and typing requirementsUpcoming Deadlines / ReleasesModule/ComponentVersionStatusExpected TimelineKey FeaturesUI Patterns1.4PlanningQ4 2022Community-requested features, improved PHP 8.1/Drupal 10 supportUI Patterns Settings2.0BetaCurrentMajor feature expansion, Layout Builder enhancementsUI StylesNext ReleaseDevelopmentQ1 2023CKEditor 5 integration, Views supportUI Theme1.0ConceptTBDCSS variable management, YAML configurationProtocol ThemeAlphaReleased-Design system testing and validationMaterial ThemeAlphaReleased-Design system testing and validationThe UI Suite Initiative continues to evolve as a comprehensive solution for design system implementation in Drupal.
